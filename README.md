Below is a professional and comprehensive README.md file for the MultiChain HealthAI project, tailored to the WaveHack/Buildathon requirements. It provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, features, and details about its alignment with Nodit’s blockchain and AI capabilities. The README is written in Markdown format, suitable for inclusion in your project’s root directory.
MultiChain HealthAI
A decentralized application (dApp) that computes a wallet health score based on activity, diversification, profitability, and security behaviors across Ethereum, Polygon, and Aptos, with AI-generated explanations for each metric.
Built for the WaveHack/Buildathon, MultiChain HealthAI leverages Nodit’s Web3 Data API and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to deliver an AI-powered, multi-chain wallet analytics platform. The app features a sleek, animated front end using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, providing an engaging user experience.

Project Overview
MultiChain HealthAI is a decentralized application that analyzes a wallet’s health across multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, and Aptos). It computes a health score based on four key metrics:
Activity: Transaction frequency and recency.
Diversification: Variety of tokens and asset types.
Profitability: Total profit and return on investment (ROI).
Security: Presence of multi-signature wallets and absence of suspicious activity.
Using Nodit’s Web3 Data API, the app fetches on-chain data, and Nodit’s MCP enables AI-driven analysis to generate natural language explanations for each metric. The front end, built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, offers a modern, responsive interface with animated progress bars and smooth transitions.
Features
Multi-Chain Wallet Analysis: Supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Aptos wallets.
Health Score Calculation: Aggregates activity, diversification, profitability, and security into a comprehensive score (0–100).
AI-Generated Insights: Provides natural language explanations for each metric, powered by Nodit’s MCP.
Interactive UI: Features animated progress bars and a clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.
Wallet Input Form: Allows users to input a wallet address and select a blockchain.
Mock Data Integration: Simulates wallet data for testing, with placeholders for Nodit API calls.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
API Integration: Axios (for Nodit Web3 Data API calls)
Blockchain: Nodit (Web3 Data API, MCP)
Supported Chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Aptos
Build Tools: Create React App, npm
Environment: Node.js
Nodit Integration
MultiChain HealthAI leverages Nodit’s powerful Web3 developer platform:
Web3 Data API: Fetches structured blockchain data (e.g., token transfers, balances) for wallet analysis. Example:
bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://web3.nodit.io/v1/ethereum/mainnet/token/getTokenTransfersByAccount \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <your-api-key>' \
  --data '{"accountAddress": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045", "fromDate": "2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "toDate": "2025-06-10T00:00:00+00:00"}'
Model Context Protocol (MCP): Enables AI-driven analysis by allowing large language models (LLMs) to dynamically invoke Nodit APIs for generating health scores and explanations. Example configuration:
json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nodit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@noditlabs/nodit-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "NODIT_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
Multi-Chain Support: Queries data across Ethereum, Polygon, and Aptos, aligning with Nodit’s multi-chain capabilities.
Note: The current implementation uses mock data for demonstration. To enable live data, configure a Nodit API key in the .env file.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js: Version 18 or higher
npm: Version 8 or higher
Nodit API Key: Sign up at nodit.io to obtain an API key for Web3 Data API and MCP access.
Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/multichain-healthai.git
cd multichain-healthai
Install Dependencies:
bash
npm install
Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Nodit API key:
env
REACT_APP_NODIT_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
Running the App
Start the Development Server:
bash
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
Test the App:
Enter a wallet address (e.g., 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045).
Select a blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon, or Aptos).
View the health score and AI-generated explanations (currently using mock data).
Usage
Input Wallet Details:
Use the form to enter a wallet address and select a blockchain.
Click “Check Health Score” to trigger the analysis.
View Health Score:
The app displays an overall score and individual scores for activity, diversification, profitability, and security.
Animated progress bars visualize each score.
Read AI Insights:
AI-generated explanations provide context for each metric, simulating Nodit’s MCP integration.
Integrate Nodit APIs:
Replace mock data in src/App.tsx (fetchWalletData) with live Nodit API calls to fetch real blockchain data.
WaveHack/Buildathon Alignment
MultiChain HealthAI aligns with the WaveHack/Buildathon’s goals of creating innovative, AI-enhanced dApps using Nodit’s platform:
AI + Data Analytics: Uses Nodit’s MCP to simulate AI-driven wallet health analysis, providing natural language insights.
Multi-Chain Innovation: Supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Aptos, leveraging Nodit’s Web3 Data API for cross-chain data retrieval.
Creative UI/UX: Features a modern, animated interface with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion, ensuring an engaging user experience.
Scalability: Designed to integrate Nodit’s real-time APIs and robust infrastructure, ensuring scalability for production use.
Accessibility: Lowers barriers to Web3 adoption by providing an intuitive wallet health dashboard.
Future Enhancements
Live Nodit API Integration: Replace mock data with real-time data from Nodit’s Web3 Data API for accurate wallet analysis.
Advanced AI Features: Use Nodit’s MCP with an LLM (e.g., Claude) to generate dynamic, context-aware insights.
Error Handling: Add UI feedback for invalid wallet addresses or API errors using toast notifications.
Additional Animations: Enhance interactivity with hover effects on score cards or transitions for explanation sections.
Deployment: Host on decentralized platforms like IPFS or traditional providers like Vercel for public access.
Expanded Chain Support: Include additional blockchains supported by Nodit (e.g., XRPL, Bitcoin).
